  Learned how to select elements, handle button clicks, and update content dynamically.

  Understood how `addEventListener` works for different buttons (Generate, Options etc.).  

- **Randomization Logic:**  
  Built custom logic for mixing alphabets, numbers, and symbols to generate secure passwords.  

- **Conditional Rendering:**  
  Applied conditions based on user’s choice (include/exclude letters, numbers, or symbols).

  Practiced handling checkboxes, ranges, and validating password length properly.  

- **Styling & UI Thinking:**  
  Improved CSS skills for creating a clean, user-friendly, and responsive layout.

  Broke down a big task (Password Generator) into smaller steps and implemented each logically.
